# Particle-Filter--CompPhy
Implementation of a Particle Filter

This repository consists of 3 types of simulations that we have created. The first simulation is a one dimensional simulation of the particle filter, in this simulation we assume the robot(or anything) is moving only in the one dimension (x-axis). The landmarks (or reference points) are placed at different locations on the x-axis and the control inputs move the robot to different locations. The contrl inputs, the size of the world, the number of particles, the sensor and motion noise standard deviation can all be changed in the PF file. The sensor model takes the distance to the nearest landmark.
